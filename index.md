| 1 | 🌐 Accepting Translations | Visit [https://translate.glucocheck.app](https://translate.glucocheck.app) to add translations for your language. |
| 2 | 👓 Looking for reviewers  | We are looking for someone to proofread the translation, and test it on their own Google Home device. This phase starts once the app is fully translated. |
| 3 | 📑 Submitted to Google     | When we have confirmed the app is working in the new language, we submit it to Google for approval. |
| 4 | ✅ Done                   | Google has approved the translation, and Gluco Check is now available in this language! |
