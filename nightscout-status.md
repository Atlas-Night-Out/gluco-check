# Nightscout Status has been taken down

If you're reading this, you probably tried using Nightscout Status and discovered it no longer works.

## 1. What happened?

Google [decided to take Nightscout Status down](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4604406/137370833-286fe4cf-cea2-4a14-9937-4001eeabe172.png) on October 15, 2021. I didn't get any warning they were going to do so.

When I asked the reason it was taken down, [I got a reply](https://i.imgur.com/2cTTxm1.png) saying it was done 'without cause'. 

## 2. Will Nightscout Status be back?

No. Though Google has said I can resubmit the app and get it reviewed again, I simply don't have the time right now. Resubmitting the app would require refactoring it, bc it used DialogFlow which has been deprecated by Google.

## 3. What now?

### Short answer: you should switch to [Gluco Check](https://glucocheck.app)

Gluco Check was already scheduled to be the successor to Nightscout Status. But because Nightscout Status has been taken down, we'll have to move a little faster than planned.

#### If you used Nightscout Status in English or Dutch

Visit https://glucocheck.app and sign up. Once your Nightscout is linked, you'll be able to use Gluco Check instead of Nightscout Status while having access to the same (and additional) features.

#### If you used Nightscout Status in another language

Visit https://pages.glucocheck.app/translations. We're trying to get Gluco Check translated as quickly as possible.

You're more than welcome to help if you can :)
